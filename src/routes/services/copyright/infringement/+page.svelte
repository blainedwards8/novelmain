        <div>
          Infringement occurs when someone violates the rights of an owner of a valid copyright without permission.
          This can occur as a result of photocopying a book, downloading an image or song from the Internet, or
          making an unauthorized copy of a movie.
        </div>

        <h1 id="defend">How can I defend against a claim of infringement?</h1>
        <div>
          A claim of infringement will either start in federal district court or in front of the <a href="/services/copyright/ccb">Copyright Claims Board</a>.
          Even if you have a valid defense against copyright infringement, you are still required to actively fight the case. There are deadlines that you must meet.
          If you don't do necessary answers or other filings, a default judgment may be made against you and you may be required to pay damages. 
          If someone has made a complaint against you, don't delay in making a reply or talking to an attorney. 
        </div>
        <h3>Elements of a Valid Infringement Claim</h3>
        <div>
          
          The first thing to know when fighting an infringement claim is what the claimant must prove. If the claimant hasn't shown each and every element,
          there is not a valid claim for infringement. These elements include:
        </div>

        <h3>Valid Defenses</h3>
        <div>
          If the claimant has shown the necessary elements above, you may still have a reason why infringement hasn't occured. These are called defenses.
