    Probate is the legal process of administering the estate of a deceased
    person, including distributing the deceased's property and assets according
    to their will or the laws of intestacy (when the deceased did not have a
    valid will).
  </p>

  <p>
    The probate process begins when the executor of the estate (the person named
    in the will to handle the deceased's affairs) files a petition with the
    court to open probate proceedings. The court will then appoint an
    administrator to oversee the probate process, if there is no named executor
    or if the executor is unable or unwilling to serve.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once probate is opened, the administrator is responsible for inventorying
    the deceased's assets, paying any outstanding debts and taxes, and
    distributing the remaining assets to the heirs or beneficiaries named in the
    will. If the deceased did not have a will, their assets will be distributed
    according to the laws of intestacy in the state where they lived.
  </p>

  <p>
    Probate can be a lengthy and complex process, and it is often necessary to
    hire an attorney to help navigate the legal procedures. In some cases, it
    may be possible to avoid probate by setting up a trust or transferring
    ownership of assets to a beneficiary before the owner's death.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's important to note that probate is a public process, and the details of
    the deceased's estate are available to the public. This can be a concern for
    those who wish to keep their affairs private.
  </p>

  <p>
    In summary, probate is the legal process of administering the estate of a
    deceased person, including distributing their property and assets according
    to their will or the laws of intestacy. It is a complex process that may
    require the assistance of an attorney, and it is a public process.
